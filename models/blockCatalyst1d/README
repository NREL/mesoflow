<-----l1--------->|
<-----------l------------->|

species: s1 and s2
reaction at catalyst: s1+site => s2+site
reaction rate=-ds1/dt=ds2/dt= k s1 site

There is advection and diffusion in gas phase:

At steady-state for s1:

v ds1/dx = D d2s1/dx2 (x<l1)
D d2s1/dx2 - k s1 = 0 (x>l1)

flux continuity at interface:
{v s1 - D ds1/dx}|(l1-) = {-D ds1/dx}|(l1+)

boundary conditions:

s1=1 at x=0
s1=0 at x=l1

ds2/dx=0 at x=0
ds2/dx=0 at x=l1


The solution can be analytically obtained
by solving the steady state equation for 
the piecewise domains and imposing the boundary 
and interface conditions
